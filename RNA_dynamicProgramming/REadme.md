## Overview
The RNAFolding class contains methods for folding an RNA sequence to determine its optimal secondary structure. The algorithm employs dynamic programming to calculate the optimal folding configuration.

## Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:
1. Compile the Java file using `javac RNAfolding.java`.
2. Run the compiled program with a text file containing RNA sequences as input. For example:
   ```shell
   java RNAfolding input.txt
